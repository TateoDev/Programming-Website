      <h1>What are programming languages</h1>
      <p>Programming languages are a method of taking syntax humans can understand and putting it in a way computers can understand. Some languages are complied (like C), meaning that the program is turned into 1s and 0s then ran. While others are interepted (like python), meaning they are turned into 1s and 0s as they run</p>
